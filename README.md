RISC-V 64LE Linux Shellcoding
=============================

This repository contains all the code used to create a minimal example
of creating shellcode for RISC-V 64LE. I attempted to do this as black-
box as possible using only the RISC-V documentation and source from
gcc, glibc, and the linux kernel. This was dual purpose to work on 
furthering my understanding of hardware specifics, to learn to
shellcode on a lesser known/new ISA, and to attempt to get some 
payloads available even before common adoption.

Repository Layout
-----------------
Inside of the `src/` directory there are simple C examples (`simpleN.c`),
assembly examples (`asmN.s`), and shellcode examples (`scN.h`) that are 
included by `sctester.c` and executed using a GCC trampoline.

The reading path is not one-to-one by the numbers, instead it should be
read in the following manner or as described in the coming blogpost:

| files | lesson |
| :----- | :------ |
|`asm1.s`, `asm2.s` | Learn about the basic calling conventions, linux specifics for system calls, data access |
| `asm3.s` | Port a program to not use the rodata section and learn about ebreak, debugging, and endianness |
| `asm4.s` | Graceful shell spawning in assembly |
| `sc1.h`, `asm5.s` | Learn about the pitfalls of shellcode and use a simple shellcode tester to check for null chars |
| `sc2.h`, `asm6.s` | Discover more pitfalls, solutions, and port the more advanced shell exec shellcode |
| `asm7.s` | Create a reverse shell in assembly |
| `asm8.s`, `sc3.h` | Port the reverse shell to shellcode |

Usage / Building
----------------
It is expected that you have a VM to test with, the instructions for
running will be here. Once you have the VM the code can either be
compiled from the directly from the root of the repository with a simple
`make` in the root of the directory. This expect you to have `gcc(1)` and
`as(1)` for assembly.

Additionally the realease page should have a copy of the bin directory 
after a successful compilation.
