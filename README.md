RISC-V 64LE Linux Shellcoding
=============================

This repository contains all the code used to create a minimal example
of creating shellcode for RISC-V 64LE. I attempted to do this as black-
box as possible using only the RISC-V documentation and source from
gcc, glibc, and the linux kernel. This was dual purpose to work on 
furthering my understanding of hardware specifics, to learn to
shellcode on a lesser known/new ISA, and to attempt to get some 
payloads available even before common adoption.
