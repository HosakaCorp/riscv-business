# This example expands on the last one by using the "write" system call 
# to print the strings using two different mechanisms. Only the first
# example should be useful for shellcoding, but the second is important
# to demonstrate how the 32-bit registers have restrictions and how to
# work with them in a position independent manner.
#
# We will print the strings:
# - AA\n\0
# - Hello MWR Labs\n\0
# 
# The first step to this is to load the values we want to print on the 
# stack using their literal values in little endian, load the other
# arguments, and call the system call like in the previous example.
# 
# This gets a bit more complicated when you realize that the `li`
# pseudoinstruction generates code differently for values greater than
# 1048575 (0xFFFFF). This is due to the fact that loading the immediate
# upper value being a U-type instruction can only take 20 bits and the
# rest of the expected 12 bits will have to be ADDI'd afterward.
#
# Remember the U-type format is imm[31:12] | rd | opcode
#
# As an example, `li a1,0xFFFFF000` will generate code as:
# > lui a1,1048575
#
# Whereas attempting to use `li a1,0x000a4141` will generate:
# > lui a1,0xa4 # 0x000a4 - Upper 20 bits
# > addiw a1,a1,321 # 0x141 - lower 12 bits
# 
# The second part of achieves the same thing as the first but uses the
# assembler macro (TODO right verbiage?) for loading the upper portion
# of the text and then the lower. This is very useful when hand writing
# asm, but not very useful for shellcoding.
#
# An additional note, the `ebreak` instruction will trigger a gdb trap
# and will allow you to debug incredibly easily. I used this very
# heavily during development to better understand. If your VM supports
# gdb, I highly suggest exploring the register (`i r`), stack (`i
# stack`), and stepping through instructions (`stepi`).
