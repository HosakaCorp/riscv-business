	# This first example is a simple system call that triggers is a
	# exit(7);
	#
	# The first step is to get a handle on the RISC-V instructions
	# from the ISA documentation and to understand how the different
	# instructions are formated. The spec can be found here and is
	# fairly readable: 
	#
	# https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/draft-20190309-ceb9d83/riscv-spec.pdf 
	#
	# There are 32 registers (and a stack pointer) and contain 4
	# core instruction formats (refered to as R, I, S, and U-type)
	# and 2 "immediate" instruction formats (B, J-type). The types 
	# of registers determine the format of the instructions, which
	# can be a bit confusing, but the machine readable format looks
	# like the following. NOTE: Remember this is little endian:
	#
	# SEE Section 25.1 in the ISA: Figure 25.1
	# 
	# There are additional extensions to the 32-bit core that are
	# relevant since we are looking at the 64-bit little endian
	# version specifically (RV64G). These define even more
	# instructions for 64-bit support and is important to 
	# understand that different CPU's support even more extensions:
	# * M - Integer multiplication and division
	# * A - Atomic instructions 
	# * F - Single-precision floating point 
	# * D - Double-precision floating point
	# * Q - Quad-precision floating point
	# * L - Decimal floating point
	# * C - Compressed instructions 
	# * B - Bit manipulation
	# * J - Dynamically translated languages
	# * T - Transactional memory
	# * P - Packed-SIMD
	# * V - Vector operations
	# * N - User-level interrupts
	# * "Zicsr" - Control and status register
	# * "Zefencei" - Instruction-fetch fence
	#
	# This means that a CPU might look like `RV64IMAFDC`, which has
	# a nice ring to it. Luckily the RISC-V team has defined the
	# bare minimum of what can be considered a "general-purpose" ISA
	# as RV32G/RV64G which contains the IMAFD, Zicsr, and Zifencei
	# extensions. So you may see a CPU like `RV64IMAFDC` called
	# `RV64GC` if it contains the expected instructions and the
	# compressed extensions. This matters for us in the shellcoding
	# process as we should attempt to stay as close to the G
	# standard as much as possible as that might be all that can be
	# expected for us to have.
	#
	# Chapter 25: RV32/64G Instruction Set Listings gives a 
	# wonderful layout and good reference for the types of 
	# instructions and a table containing the instructions in a 
	# good reference table.
	#
	# The RISC-V "green card" has a few pieces of outdated information, 
	# but is also a great reference that I used heavily:
	#
	# https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1617/ECAD+Arch/files/docs/RISCVGreenCardv8-20151013.pdf
	#
	# In the instruction land it is important to note one additional
	# thing, the assembler understands a set of pseudoinstructions.
	# The pseudoinstructions are linker understood instructions that
	# are aliases for common functions, the table of these can be
	# seen in Table 26.2 with a translation of what the instructions
	# are translated to. This can be rather confusing as certain
	# instructions may generate their translated counterparts or
	# not. An example is the `li` pseudo-instruction that may
	# generate different code depending on data is being loaded. The
	# confusing-ness is even more confusing based on the ISA
	# specification specifically stating that "This chapter is a
	# placeholder for an assembly programmerâ€™s manual" which is not
	# particularly helpful. 
	#
	# The second step to understanding this is to understand the
	# calling convention in RISC-V and then what the implimentation
	# actually looks like. Luckily the calling convention is pretty
	# easy to find and has a very easy to understand table:
	# https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/riscv-calling.pdf 
	#
	# This calling convention gives us a starting point and some
	# hints about how things work after objdump'ing simple1.c, but
	# for some more context it is better to probably go straight to
	# the kernel and libc: 
	# 
	# https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/riscv/sysdep.h;h=5470ea3d2a6882ad34e5fc924517fd6fc98add2b;hb=HEAD
	# https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/arch/riscv
	# http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscall.2.html#NOTES 
	#
	# Based on the documentation in syscall(2) and glibc - a7 will
	# hold the exit syscall and a0 will be the initial first 
	# argument and will also hold the return value from the syscall
	# after execution
	# ecall is the replacement for scall that might be seen in 
	# earlier versions of the RISC-V ISA
	#
	# The last step is to discover what the actual syscall number is
	# and for this if you are on the fedora image you can check
	# /usr/include/asm-generic/unistd.h
	# or
	# https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/tools/include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h
	#
	# A quick grep for __NR_exit indicates that the system call is
	# 93.
	# 
	# To set this up we need to load our exit value (7) into the
	# first argument for the system call. Many syscall's are wrapped
	# by libc and you should make sure to use the kernel versions of
	# the calls and not what is expected from libc.
	#
	# The first part of this clears the a0 register using RV64G
	# standard instructions. The second uses the `li`
	# pseudoinstruction to load the systemcall number.
	xor a0,a0,a0	# Zero out the first argument (a0)
	addi a0,a0,0x7  # Add 7 to a0. addi dest,src,immediate
	li a7, 93	# 93 is the __NR_exit syscall
	ecall		# trigger system call
